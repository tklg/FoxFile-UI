		<h2 class="title">Privacy Policy</h2>
		<article class="content float" priv-v1>
			<p class="lastmod">Last updated February 14, 2016</p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy explains the practices and policies of the FoxFile Service ("FoxFile").</p>
			<p>You may access FoxFile from desktop computers, laptop and tablet computers, mobile phones, storage products, and third-party applications.</p>
			<p>By your use of FoxFile, you consent to your information being used in accordance with this Privacy Policy and you agree to consent and comply with the FoxFile Terms of Service.</p>
			<p>FoxFile is a place for you to store Private Data Files. Private Data Files are files which are not already public and are not intended to be made public through FoxFile and belong solely to you and against which no one else has a legitimate copyright or property claim.</p>
			<p>FoxFile is not intended for use by persons under the age of 13. If we become aware that a person under the age of 13 has provided us with information, we will take actions to delete such information from FoxFile.</p>
			<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
			<p>“Personal Information” is information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a person. Your Personal Information is considered confidential and private to you.</p>
			<p>You may be asked to provide your Personal Information when you create a FoxFile account or anytime you are in contact with us.</p>
			<h2>Examples of Collected Personal Information</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>By creating / updating an account with FoxFile, you may provide us with Personal Information including but not limited to your name, picture, email addresses, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, postal addresses and location information. We may also collect certain preference and demographic information from you.</li>
			<li>By importing data into FoxFile from other products and services, you may provide us with Personal Information, for example contacts and calendar information from your email provider or social networking service.</li>
			<li>By sending, receiving and sharing content through FoxFile with other people, you may provide us with other people’s Personal Information (such as email addresses). For example, you may provide us with other people’s Personal Information when sending or sharing files or recommending FoxFile. Likewise, other people may provide us with Personal Information about you (such as email addresses) in a similar manner.</li>
			<li>By visiting other websites that may have placed Personal Information in your URL prior to coming to our website, which we have no control over, you may provide us with Personal Information.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>How We Do (and Do Not) Use Personal Information</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><p>We will not sell your Personal Information to others.</p></li>
			<li><p>We may use Personal Information to contact you via email to provide information related to our other products and services, and to personalize and better understand your use of the service.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We may use Personal Information to help us develop, deliver and improve our products and services. This includes use for internal purposes such as auditing or research and analysis of our products, services and communications.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We may occasionally use Personal Information to send you important notices such as software updates or notices related to your purchases and billing status, changes to our policies, or changes to our products or services. Because this information is critical in nature, you may not be able to opt out of receiving these notices.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We may use Personal Information to administer any special program you may have voluntarily entered into, such as a sweepstake, contest or promotion.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We may also combine your Personal Information with other information to provide and improve FoxFile, our content, and advertising.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere in FoxFile according to your preferences. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If Personal Information is combined with Non-Personal information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information and will be treated under this Privacy Policy as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
			<h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
			<p>“Non-Personal Information” is information that does not permit identification of any specific person. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose Non-Personal Information (which does not include your Private Data Files).</p>
			<h2>Here Are Some Examples of Non-Personal Information We Collect and How We May Use It:</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><p>We collect Non-Personal Information, including but not limited to language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser and Device type, mobile network provider/carrier, websites visited before and after ours, search terms used, location, and the time zone where FoxFile is used. Unless otherwise specified by local law, we consider Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers to be Non-Personal Information. We record this information in log files and use this type of information to better manage FoxFile usage and improve our products, services, and advertising.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We collect information related to activity usage, performance metrics and configuration settings on our website and from our products and services. This information is aggregated and used primarily to help us improve our website, products and services. Aggregated data is considered Non-Personal information and is not used to identify a person.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>We also may use internal and third party analytic systems to analyze trends with Non-Personal Information.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Collection, Storage and Use of Private Data Files</h2>
			<p>We collect and store the files you use within FoxFile, including files you upload, download, access, send, or share.</p>
			<p>We may access your uploaded file information (file extensions, sizes, thumbnails, modified dates, etc.) for the purpose of providing system maintenance, management, and technical support.</p>
			<p>We may process any information we collect in the country where it was collected as well as in other countries.</p>
			<h2>Free Accounts</h2>
			<p>AFTER YOU REGISTER FOR A FREE FoxFile ACCOUNT, WE WILL PERIODICALLY CONTACT YOU VIA EMAIL TO NOTIFY YOU OF NEW OR UPGRADED SERVICES. YOU MAY OPT-OUT FROM THESE CONTACTS BY DEACTIVATING YOUR ACCOUNT. IF YOU NO LONGER WISH TO MAINTAIN A FREE ACCOUNT, PLEASE GO TO THE FoxFile ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT PAGE, OR CONTACT US AND WE WILL DEACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT AND REMOVE YOU FROM OUR CONTACTS LIST.</p>
			<h2>Technology Used to Collect Information</h2>
			<p>To collect information, we use various technologies, such as “cookies”, pixel tags and web beacons on our website, in FoxFile, and in email messages and advertisements. These technologies help improve the user experience – for example by keeping a user logged in and remembering their username or other information between sessions.</p>
			<p>The method by which information is collected is not used to determine whether it is Personal Information or Non-Personal Information. Instead, that determination is made in accordance with definitions in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h2>Third Party Disclosures</h2>
			<h3>Service providers working with FoxFile</h3>
			<p>At times we may make certain Personal Information available to strategic partners and service providers that work with us to provide our services, or that help us market FoxFile. For example, we use third parties to process credit card information for orders in accordance with PCI compliance security guidelines.</p>
			<p>In addition, if you provide third parties access to your information and account - for example, via FoxFile APIs, their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.</p>
			<h3>Legal requirements and policy enforcement</h3>
			<p>It may be necessary – due to law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for us to disclose your Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, and Private Data Files. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>
			<p>We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with our service terms, or to protect our operations or other users.</p>
			<p>In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale or change of ownership we may transfer any and all information, including Personal Information we collect, to the new owner.</p>
			<h3>Links to external websites</h3>
			<p>Our websites may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies when visiting third party websites. We are not responsible for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our users.</p>
			<h2>Security</h2>
			<p>It is your responsibility to keep your FoxFile password private and secure. We strongly recommend against sharing your login and password with others.</p>
			<!-- <p>We take industry standard precautions through administrative, technical and physical measures to protect your Personal Information, Non-Personal Information and Private Data Files against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p> -->
			<!-- cant really do this yet :p -->
			<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages that collect any Personal Information. Using an SSL-enabled browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer is required when your Personal Information is transmitted over the Internet.</p>
			<p>When you use some features of FoxFile, such as sending files, sharing folders or posting comments, the Personal Information, Non Personal Information, and Private Data Files you share are visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the information you disclose in this way.</p>
			<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems but cannot guarantee these security measures will prevent third parties from obtaining Personal Information, Non Personal Information and Private Data Files by illegal actions or attacks. Should such an attack occur, we will notify you in accordance with local law and we will supply the appropriate authorities with available information on the third party in the event the attack comes under prosecution.</p>
			<h2>Updating Your Information</h2>
			<p>You may, at any time, update, correct or complete your Personal Information by accessing your FoxFile account. Your Personal Information and other information will be retained for as long as necessary to comply with this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
			<p>We reserve the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. The latest revision of this policy will be published on a webpage accessible from <a href="https://tkluge.net/foxfile">https://tkluge.net/foxfile</a>. Your continued use of FoxFile will signify your acceptance and consent to all current policies and agreements.</p>
