		<h2 class="title">Terms of Service</h2>
		<article class="content float" tos-v1>
			<p class="lastmod">Last updated February 14, 2016</p>
			<p>The FoxFile Terms of Service (the "Terms" or "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, either an individual or a single legal entity ("You" or "you" or "Your" or "your"), and FoxFile for the FoxFile service ("FoxFile" or "Product" or "we" or "our"). These Terms govern your use of FoxFile, including any updates and accompanying written documentation.</p>
			<p>Your use of FoxFile constitutes your binding legal agreement to these Terms, which are subject to change at any time by FoxFile. If you are not legally able to be bound by these Terms, your use of FoxFile is prohibited.</p>
			<p>You acknowledge and agree that FoxFile may occasionally contact you via email. Please refer to FoxFile's Privacy Policy, (<a href="https://tkluge.net/foxfile/privacy">https://tkluge.net/foxfile/privacy</a>) for information about how we use, transfer and share information we collect and you store within FoxFile.</p>
			<h2>Your Data and Privacy</h2>
			<p>With FoxFile, you can submit and access your data, information, files and folders (known as "your Data"). When doing so, you retain full ownership of your Data. These Terms do not grant us any rights or intellectual property to your Data apart from the limited rights we use to deliver the FoxFile service, which are explained here and in our Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>By using FoxFile, you grant us permission to use your Data to provide product features and to technically administer the service itself. Product features include items like storing, sharing/accessing and creating and displaying file previews. Technical administration includes all architectural decisions we make and activity we engage in to deliver the FoxFile service to you, such as the number of file copies we maintain for backup and service reliability, how we store data, or the connections we establish to your devices. This permission also extends to trusted third parties we may work with to deliver the FoxFile service.</p>
			<p>FoxFile may contain links to other third party websites or resources. Your use of the third party materials is governed by their terms and not by this Agreement. We are not responsible for nor do we endorse these third parties.</p>
			<p>You are responsible for maintaining and protecting your data in FoxFile and FoxFile is not responsible for any loss or corruption of your files or information, or for backing up such information.</p>
			<p>FoxFile is not intended for use by persons under the age of 13 years old. By accepting these terms, you represent that you are at least 13 years old.</p>
			<h2>Accounts, Passwords and Security</h2>
			<p>You must be a registered user to access the Product. Individual users must register using their name, and entity users must register under the legal name of their entity. You are responsible for keeping your password private and secure, and are prohibited from sharing your login and password with others. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your user name.</p>
			<h2>Acceptable Use and Conduct</h2>
			<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct and your Data content uploaded or otherwise placed into FoxFile. We are not responsible for the legality and appropriateness of information in FoxFile that you may be able to access or view through your use. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless FoxFile and its suppliers from any loss, cost, liability, and expense arising from or related to your data, your use of the Products, or your violation of these terms.</p>
			<p>The Products are made available to you only for your personal or internal business use, which use must comply with all applicable FoxFile policies, laws, rules and regulations and must not infringe or violate third party rights. You may not make commercial use of the Products, including but not limited to selling, licensing, providing services, or distributing the Products or any part thereof to any third party.</p>
			<p>Any unauthorized use of any FoxFile computer system is a violation of these Terms and may violate certain federal and state laws. Such violations may subject the unauthorized user and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties. FoxFile may immediately and without prior notice to You, remove any content or data, or suspend or cancel accounts if it becomes aware of any misuse or illegal actions associated with an account or user.</p>
			<p>You must comply with these Terms and use FoxFile responsibly and in a way to not interfere with the use, privacy or rights of others. When using FoxFile, you must not, and must not attempt to, use the services to do any of the following things:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>copy or upload files or information unless you have a legal right to the files or information;</li>
			<li>probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system, or attempt to circumvent any security or authentication measures;</li>
			<li>access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of FoxFile or attempt to access or search FoxFile through nonpublic interfaces;</li>
			<li>attempt to disrupt any user or network by sending a virus, malware, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing;</li>
			<li>send unsolicited communications, promotions or advertisements, or spam;</li>
			<li>attempt to access another user's account;</li>
			<li>send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information, including "spoofing" or "phishing";</li>
			<li>publish anything that is fraudulent, misleading, or infringes another's rights;</li>
			<li>misrepresent yourself or affiliation with an entity; or</li>
			<li>publish or share materials that are offensive, defamatory, or unlawful.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Changes to FoxFile Products and Terms</h2>
			<p>FoxFile reserves the right at any time to modify, suspend, or discontinue providing the Product or any part thereof in its sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>
			<p>FoxFile reserves the right at any time to modify these Terms in its sole discretion, without liability to you. This Agreement, as amended, will be effective upon use of the FoxFile Products for all existing users immediately after posting of any amended terms on the FoxFile website. You agree to be bound by this Agreement, as modified. If you do not agree to any changes to the Terms, you must stop using FoxFile and terminate your account immediately.</p>
			<p>Please review the most current version of this Agreement from time to time, located at <a href="https://tkluge.net/foxfile/tos">https://tkluge.net/foxfile/tos</a> (or such successor URL as FoxFile may provide), so that you will be apprised of any changes.</p>
			<h2>License to FoxFile</h2>
			<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, FoxFile grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited and revocable license to use the Product (including but not limited to the client software) solely and exclusively for personal or internal business purposes. Certain third party code may be provided with, or contained in, the Product. The third-party license terms accompanying such code, and not the terms of this Agreement, will govern your use of such code. FoxFile reserves all other rights to its Products.</p>
			<p>The Products and their structure, organization, source code, and documentation contain valuable trade secrets of FoxFile and its licensors, and accordingly you agree not to (and agree not to allow third parties to) (1) sublicense, transfer, or distribute any aspect of the Products or any derivative thereof to any third party, (2) modify, adapt, translate, or prepare derivative works from the Product, (3) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Product, (4) extract portions of the software's files for use in other applications, or (5) remove, obscure, or alter FoxFile's or any third party's trademarks or copyrights or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within or accessed in conjunction with or through the Products.</p>
			<h2>Renewals</h2>
			<p>You agree that FoxFile shall have the right to, automatically and without notice, renew your license to continue to use the Products upon expiration of your license period. You agree that if you elect to not permit FoxFile the right to automatically renew your license to use the Products or maintain your credit card information on file, then FoxFile may terminate your license upon expiration of your license period.</p>
			<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
			<p>You acknowledge that FoxFile or third parties own all right, title and interest in and to the computer source code related to the Product, portions thereof, or software or content provided through or in conjunction with the Product, including without limitation all intellectual property rights. Except for the license granted in this Section, all rights in and to the Products are reserved, and no implied licenses are granted by FoxFile.</p>
			<!-- <p>If you have comments on the Products or ideas on how to improve them, please visit <a href="https://support.tkluge.net/">https://support.tkluge.net/</a>. Please note that by doing so, you also grant FoxFile a perpetual, fully paid, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable license, with right of sublicense, to use and incorporate your ideas or comments into the Products (or third party software, content, or services), and to otherwise exploit your ideas and comments, in each case without further compensation.</p> -->
			<!-- <h2>Copyright</h2>
			<p>When using FoxFile, you must respect the intellectual property rights of others. We will respond to any notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law and are properly reported to us through our DMCA process (<a href="https://tkluge.net/foxfile/dmca">https://tkluge.net/foxfile/dmca</a>).

			<h2>Pricing Terms and Conditions</h2>
			<h3>Upgraded Accounts</h3>
			<p>FoxFile may offer you the option of increasing your account storage space beyond the free amount for a fee. By doing so, your account will be converted to an Upgraded Account and will not be subject to some of the restrictions placed on Free Accounts as described below.</p>
			<p>FoxFile will automatically charge your credit card monthly or yearly, depending upon which Upgraded Account you select. If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or FoxFile is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, FoxFile reserves the right to revoke access to your FoxFile account and to use our discretion to delete some or all of Your Data so as to reduce your storage space to below the free amount, and to convert your Upgraded Account to a Free Account (which is subject to the restrictions described below).</p>
			<h3>Billing</h3>
			<p>The fees for your Upgraded Account will be billed from the date you elect, or convert to, an Upgraded Account and will be automatically billed each month or year on the anniversary of the commencement of your Upgraded Account. You can click on the link on your "Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period.</p>
			<p>You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary for reasons that include differing amounts due to promotional offers, differing amounts due to changes in your account, or changes in the amount of applicable sales tax. You authorize us to charge your credit card for such varying amounts. FoxFile may also periodically authorize your credit card in anticipation of account or related charges. All fees and charges are non-cancelable and nonrefundable and no credits will be given for partially used periods.</p>
			<p>Should you elect to increase your Upgraded Account to a larger amount of storage space, the commencement date for your next renewal period will be reset and you will be billed for the first month or year of the upgraded level of service on a pro-rata basis.</p>
			<p>FoxFile may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges, from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email or on the website. If you want to use a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your information by accessing your "Account" page. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information and payment information current and updated.</p>
			<h3>Cancelling Your Account</h3>
			<p>Your FoxFile Upgraded Account will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your Upgraded Account or we terminate it. You must cancel your Upgraded Account before it renews each month or year in order to avoid billing of the next month's or year's fees to your credit card. FoxFile will bill the monthly or yearly fees associated with your Upgraded Account plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us.</p>
			<p>You may cancel your Upgraded Account at any time, and cancellation will be effective immediately. If you wish to cancel your Upgraded Account, you may do so via your "Account" page. Should you elect to cancel your Upgraded Account, please note that you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged monthly or annual fees.</p>
			<p>By signing up for a FoxFile Upgraded Account and providing FoxFile with your payment account information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.</p>
			<h3>Free Accounts</h3>
			<p>FoxFile allows you to store a certain amount of data free of charge. FoxFile reserves the right to change the amount of free storage or terminate Free Accounts at any time. FoxFile also reserves the right to contact you via email to notify you of new or upgraded services. FoxFile may, at times, award your account additional free storage through various promotions, such as a referral program. You must follow the rules and restrictions of any such promotion to be eligible for additional storage. All free storage on your FoxFile account is subject to the same restrictions contained in these terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Free Account is inactive for three (3) months, then FoxFile may delete any or all of Your Data. At least 30 days' notice will be provided to the associated email address(es) on a FoxFile account in the event of changes to the amount of free storage, account termination for any reason other than abuse, or deletion of data due to inactivity.</p>
			<p>To help provide a reliable experience by monitoring our systems' load, the Free Accounts are subject to a maximum bandwidth limit on shared data of 40GB per day. Sharing large files can cause the account to exceed the bandwidth limit, in which case the public links will be suspended without notice until your bandwidth allotment has been reset at the beginning of the following day.</p>
			<p>If you no longer wish to maintain a free account, please go to the FoxFile Account Management page to deactivate your free account, or contact us and we will deactivate your free account.</p>
			<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
			<p>This Agreement is effective upon any use of FoxFile and remains in effect until your account is terminated. Terms that by their nature extend beyond termination shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
			<p>Your right to use FoxFile automatically terminates if you fail to comply with these Terms. FoxFile reserves the right to refuse or discontinue participation to any user at any time at its sole discretion. You agree that, upon such termination, you will discontinue all use of the Products and that your access rights will immediately terminate.</p>
			<p>If this Agreement terminates, other than for your failure to comply, FoxFile will use commercially reasonable efforts to make your Data available for you by request only for a period of fifteen (15) calendar days. FoxFile has no obligation to provide you with a copy of your Data and may remove and discard any Data.</p>

			<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE PRODUCT, AND ALL THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR THROUGH THE PRODUCT, AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE PRODUCT AND SUCH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AND SERVICES.</p>
			<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND WHERE THAT IS IN EFFECT, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
			<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
			<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL FoxFile, OR ITS SUPPLIERS, RESELLERS, PARTNERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE PRODUCT, WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, (EVEN IF FoxFile HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES).</p>
			<p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF FoxFile, AND ITS SUPPLIERS, RESELLERS, PARTNERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED (i) US$25 IF NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN PAID BY YOU TO FoxFile OR (ii) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR FoxFile IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CLAIM.</p>
			<p>THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM USE OR MISUSE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE PRODUCT, FROM INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, OR FROM THE INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, OR TERMINATION OF THE PRODUCT (INCLUDING SUCH DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES). SUCH LIMITATION SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING A FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
			<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR BODILY INJURY OR THE LIMITATIONS ABOVE AND IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
			<h2>Export Restrictions</h2>
			<p>You acknowledge and agree that the Product that is the subject of this Agreement may be controlled for export purposes. You agree to comply with all United States export laws and regulations. You assume sole responsibility for any required export approval and/or licenses and all related costs and for the violation of any United States export law or regulation. If you are located in a country subject to embargo by the United States government, you are not entitled to use FoxFile.</p>
			<h2>Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and Venue</h2>
			<p>THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE PRODUCT AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY NEW JERSEY LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE PRODUCT OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF BERGEN COUNTY, NEW JERSEY, AND BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE</p>
			<!-- ???? -->
			<p>Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, relating to or in connection with this agreement, including the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally resolved by arbitration. The tribunal shall have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and that this agreement does not permit CLASS arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or CLASS member in any CLASS or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or CLASS proceeding.</p>
			<h2>Entire Agreement and Assignment</h2>
			<p>This Agreement, which incorporates the FoxFile Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the Products. FoxFile failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by FoxFile</p>
			<p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement. FoxFile may freely assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be void.</p>
			<p>If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted which as closely as possible reflects FoxFile intent.</p>
