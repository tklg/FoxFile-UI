# FoxFile
Because I wanted to try to make an online file management thingy too.
Currently in use at:  
[lucianoalberto.zapto.org/foxfile](http://lucianoalberto.zapto.org/foxfile)

#### What it has so far:  
- Drag n' Drop uploading of files (and normal uploading too)  
- Creation of new folders to put stuff in
- Renaming and deletion of said folders (and files too)
- Previews for text, image, audio, and video files
- Text file previews are in the CodeMirror editor
- Text file previews can also be used to edit the text file
- Drag n' Drop files to move them between folders
- Shift + click on files to select multiple to drag/drop/delete/move/download
- Single/multiple file downloading
- A move file modal for sending files to folders that are not shown
- An account settings page
- A server settings page for the owner
- A color settings page to change the color scheme (default is orange and gray)

#### What it doesn't have yet:
- Mobile UI - doesn't work on small displays
- Responsive file bars - currently always uses 3 (2x 25% width, 1x 50% width)
- Resource optimization (codemirror is a lot of separate scripts <.<)
- Sharing files with anyone
